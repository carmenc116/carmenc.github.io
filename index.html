	<h3><u> Food in Boston </u></h3>
	<p><i> Asian | Desserts | American </i></p>
	<p> Boston is home to diverse foods from classy brunch diners like Stephanie’s and Sonsie on Newbury Street to local Asian diners like Gourmet Dumpling and Pho Countryside in Chinatown. <p>

	<p> Located right on the campus stretch of Commonwealth Ave, we have Noodle Street with different takes on Asian noodles, the classic Starbucks, Otto’s Pizza all the way from Portland, Maine and many other chain stores. On the west side of campus where Comm Ave leads into Allston-Brighton, it is food heaven. This is the hub of Korean food and other Asian cuisines amongst some Brazilian bakeries, Mexican restaurants, and the infamous Tavern in the Square. On the south side of campus along Beacon Street, tiny shops and cozy cafes dominate the area. From the Japonaise bakery filled with Japanese-French treats to Tatte that offers trendy foods and coffee, this area is perfect for millennial spirits and Instagram addicts to get good food and take aesthetic pictures. Boston University also sees many food trucks such as Zinnekin’s waffles, RiceBurg, and others on campus. <p>

	<p> The best spots in Boston for Asian food is either in Chinatown or Allston. Destinations in Boston good for Italian food is the North End with many American restaurants in the Financial District and the Seaport area. Some of my favorite places to go for one of my favorite foods, noodles, are Hokkaido Santouka and Ganko Ittetsu that offer delicious ramen and you can't forget about Futago and its handmade udon dishes. </p>

	<h4><u> Friends in Boston </u></h4>
	<p><i> Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 </i></p>

	<p> Throughout my years living right in the heart of the city of Boston, I've made many new friends and reconnected with many old friendes. Boston is a hub of bustling activity and people and through these experienes, friendships are formed. These are the people that are the ones that laugh with me through the good times and help me get through the difficulty times. In these three years, I have learned and grown a lot as a person and shaped primarily by these people and many more. Friendships easily come and go but those that stick with you are real gems. </p>

	<h5><u> Fun in Boston </u></h5>
	<p><i> Yippee | Yay | Hooray </i></p>
	<p>While living in the city of Boston for undergrad, there are many things to do in and around the area from hiking the Skyline Trail to hammocking on the Esplanade to visiting the Lawn on D. Unlike BC, Boston University's campus is actually in Boston so there is plenty of access to many destinations via Massachusetts' <i> amazing, advanced, superb, efficient, wonderful, fast, and clean </i> transportation system.</p>

	<p> I love the feeling of the crisp fall air in Boston as we return to campus to begin the semester and the light spring breeze during finals season. In between the busy schoolwork, I catch my breath by enjoying the nature around us even in the city! My favorite past time when the weather is nice is hanging out on the Esplanade, nestled in my hammock, by myself or with a friend or two. Despite the bustling vibe of the city, there are still opportunities to take the time to pause and enjoy the scenery or treat yourself to boba from the plethora of shops around Boston. Boba is typically a guilty pleasure to indulge in once in a while... but sometimes you end up binging six cups in one day. </p>
